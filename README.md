## Summary
The player is tasked with retrieving a beloved figure given to them by their good friend who is a cat lady. They travel through their suburban neighborhood, fight their annoying neighbour in search for their prized possession and eventually leave the neighbourhood in pursuit of it.
Our game features a 2.5 perspective world the player can walk around in and turn based combat similar to that in Pokemon games and a funny twist at the gameâ€™s conclusion. Other features include a boss fight, NPC characters who provide the player with power ups, and a comedic tone in the game overall.

## How To Play

### Main Menu
After going through the initial loading screen, you are taken to the Main Menu, where you are able to interact with the buttons using Left Mouse Button.
* Play: Takes you to the main game and the open world
* Combat: Allows you to access the combat immediately, acting like a freeplay mode
* Options: Takes you to the options menu, allowing you to adjust settings and view credits
* Exit: Closes the game

### Play: Open World
In the Open World, you are able to walk around the map which is the neighborhood with the WASD keys. When there are NPC's or areas that allow you to interact with, you will start the interaction using the E key. Button prompts will appear after, allowing you to click them with Left Mouse Button.

### Combat
The combat part of the game is accessed in the open world and through the combat button in the main menu. The Player must use the abilities given and earned through exploration to fight against The Annoying Neighbor.

## Installation
To install the game, you are able to download all of the game files directly through this Git repository. Ensure that after downloading, all game files are within the same folders and are not moved anywhere on your PC to prevent crashes or unintended bugs.

## Tools Used
* Godot Game Engine Version 4.2
* Audacity: For sound effects
* Music Maker Jam: For music samples to create tracks

## Potential Expansion
This game was created in a 14 Week time period. If we were able to continue working on this game for several more weeks, we could have included more characters, more abilities and powers, more enemies to fight, and newer areas outside the neighborhood to explore. There is so many more things we can do for the game, but for the time we had, we are really proud of our work.
